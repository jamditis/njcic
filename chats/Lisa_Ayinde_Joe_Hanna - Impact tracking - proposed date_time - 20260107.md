[@0:00](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=0.62) \- **Joe Amditis**

There you go.

[@0:01](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1.32) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

Hi, Joe. What's up, Joe?

[@0:03](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=3.94) \- **Joe Amditis**

Hey, where are you? I am in Phoenix, Arizona at the AI and Journalism Accelerator for the Knight Foundation. That sounds like a lot of fun.

[@0:14](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=14.08) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

That sounds really like lot of I'm going to lie.

[@0:16](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=16.18) \- **Joe Amditis**

It's a bunch of the panel so far, the first two keynotes, whereas the CTE, I'm not kidding, that's his actual title, as in the brain damage, of Salesforce, and then the president of ASU.

Telling us how AI is going to be a human right soon, you know, like healthcare and electricity and water and housing and all those things.

It was fun to that . And then, like, the president of ASU, like, pulled out his phone and showed his, like, girl voice AI that he uses, and it was just very tone-deaf and weird, and I thought I was in enemy territory, because I was sitting in the front row like a nerd, and I'm hearing people around me going, mmm, mmm, making terrible voices, and I'm like,

And I finally, I realized people in background were like, I need to talk about this because they didn't have any Q\&A.

Smart. And so I finally found somebody in a bunch of people in the back, apparently, who were just absolutely mortified and were, we should talk to it for the rest of the night until like 1130\.

So I found my people is good, you know, but woof, man.

**ACTION ITEM: Brief Hannah re: impact-tracking plan \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=75.9999)**

[@1:20](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=80.16) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

Well, at least, at least it was fun, right?

[@1:23](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=83.44) \- **Ayinde Merrill (njcivicinfo.org)**

That part, yes, that part was fun.

[@1:24](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=84.92) \- **Joe Amditis**

Yeah.

[@1:26](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=86.32) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

So I, what I wanted to talk to you about a little bit was, and I, I think, you know, Hannah was supposed to join, but she's not here.

So I'll just brief her when we're done. But the issue is, what, specifically in, you had made a suggestion about Google Analytics.

[@1:49](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=109.0) \- **Joe Amditis**

I did? Yes.

[@1:51](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=111.32) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

And you, this was before Christmas and you, and you, you said, you know, maybe we could get into their Google Analytics and Oh,

Oh, oh, oh, I see.

[@2:01](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=121.04) \- **Joe Amditis**

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I thought you were talking about our Google Analytics. was like, that place is scary to me, so.

For our grantees.

[@2:09](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=129.38) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

And so that's really, I thought that that might be a good place to start with Ayinde.

[@2:16](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=136.0) \- **Joe Amditis**

Are you guys getting an echo? Is that on my end? Are you getting an echo? No, I'm good.

[@2:21](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=141.32) \- **Ayinde Merrill (njcivicinfo.org)**

Okay. All right. I'm going to mute while you guys talk, just in case.

[@2:24](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=144.42) \- **Joe Amditis**

Yeah.

[@2:25](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=145.24) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

So, you know, I was thinking that Ayinde, if he had more information about what we were asking, that he could start the process of maybe asking the grantees to give us access.

Does that make sense to you?

[@2:42](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=162.16) \- **Joe Amditis**

I, it does. I feel like that might be jumping the gun a little bit, especially if we don't have a clear plan on what exact data we need and what, you know, what we're going to do with it.

You know, what kind of access do we need? Do they even use Google Analytics? You know, what if they don't?

I think we need, we probably, eventually we can. But I think we probably want to come to them with a pretty succinct and concrete plan of like why and what why we need it, what we're going to do with it and how much we actually need.

And I think we talked when we had talked, I got to pull up my notes from when we had talked so I can just refresh my memory.

But I think there were there were other things, I think, first as well that we wanted to see. You wanted to see, I believe, what we could do with the existing limited data that we have.

Am I correct?

[@3:29](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=209.34) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

So I think that there's there's two things, right? One is there's a database project where maybe we want to bring the databases together, right?

And that was something you said you can help us with. But in the process of that conversation, we said I mentioned it would be great if I could even say how many people are reading the materials that our grantees are publishing.

And then I thought you said, well, we could collect it. Through Google Analytics. then I was thinking, you know, because to be clear about this, while it doesn't have to be done like in January or February, as we get closer into the legislative season, which is February, March, April, and May, that data, any kind of data like that that would help me to convince people that we have a large scope and scale of people that are reading our materials and related things like that would be extremely helpful to make a case to fund us.

[@4:30](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=270.04) \- **Joe Amditis**

Okay, yeah, I'm looking at my notes now. You had recommended that we get the Google Analytics. And I said that it took me like four or five years to even set up ours.

So I'm not sure how deep they are in it. I mean, we can certainly ask, but I hear the concern.

And I do remember us talking about, we want to have concrete numbers that we can point to and show legislators that, hey, the money that you've been dumping into this, you know, experimental project for the last couple of years is having actual results.

And not just, you know. Hey, we gave money to 20 people, you know, I'm not saying that, not to diminish, that's not what you're saying, but I think that's a good, that's a good note to have.

I would, I don't know how, how much Google handle, I mean, Google, don't like, sure, they're going to give us site views, we want to see how many pages, page views, we want to see the, the traffic and the engagement on the stories.

**ACTION ITEM: Research GA metrics/access; draft grantee comms re: page views \+ privacy \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=313.9999)**

And, and we compare that with testimonials and, you know, reader and community feedback and stuff like that. I would like to do a little research, a little more research on what kind of info we can glean from Google, Google Analytics.

And I would probably, we would probably want to know at least a general survey sort of, of who uses Google Analytics, if they use it at all.

I personally, I mean, I love my computer and the Google dashboards are, scare me, they are terrible. So I would bet, I would be willing, more than willing to bet at least half a paycheck that, you know, a majority of them, if they have it set up, barely use it.

They just kind of set it up, you know, when they started. They don't go back to it and don't do anything with it.

That's being very pessimistic. Maybe we'll be surprised, but I think either way, even if they have anything, it would be much better if we came up with a set of parameters of what we're looking for, what we want to do with it.

Outside of just, we want to show it to legislators. We want to say, like, here's the stats we're interested in and so forth.

Ayinde?

[@6:23](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=383.5) \- **Ayinde Merrill (njcivicinfo.org)**

Yeah, I know we mentioned last time is Blue Engine would be a good first step with this state workflow.

Maybe we just start a small sample size of, know, Blue Engine has, I think, put 40 or 30 people through that program.

And I know they set up some type of analytic tracking as well. So I'm wondering if we just ask David, like, hey, we're trying to do this.

Let's look at tracking the 25 newsrooms that we put through the celebrator last year and glean from that. We kind of

The Tufo, too, is I know for a fact that David and their crew take a snapshot of engagement of all the news from before they start the accelerator.

they take engagement.

[@7:14](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=434.38) \- **Joe Amditis**

they and optic pictures? That's amazing. Okay.

[@7:16](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=436.34) \- **Ayinde Merrill (njcivicinfo.org)**

Yeah, so they have, like, engagement where their revenue was before the accelerator, and then they do another analysis of, like, a post-service as well.

So I think David and that crew, especially just, I'm talking, like, exclusively for our Blue Engine Accelerator program, is that, and we can tell kind of two stories.

It's like, we gave money to these organizations. We also gave them assistance. And not only did we give them money, we also amplified it through this training, too.

I think that may be a decent course of action with this, too. And I think because they have access to, and they've been working so closely, I think it'd be easier to ask if we partner.

Blue Engine on this and say, hey, we're looking for this. What's the best way to get there? Yeah, I think that's perfect.

[@8:09](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=489.921) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

Okay. So you feel like the next step is let's talk to Blue Engine.

[@8:14](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=494.201) \- **Joe Amditis**

Yeah, I had no idea that they did those before and after snapshots. If they have those, that's incredible. That's exactly what we need as a starting point.

And if I get my hands on even like a little sample of that kind of data, I can go spin out from there and make sure that we're we're in good shape.

[@8:31](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=511.421) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

But I want to say I'm not so interested like that their revenue went up. Although I'm not I'm not not interested about that.

I'm more interested about readership. Okay. I'd be more interested in how many hits they get on their website.

[@8:50](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=530.101) \- **Joe Amditis**

Yeah. You're saying because you think that that you believe that that's what the legislators want to see?

[@8:56](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=536.241) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

I mean, I'm not expecting them to be like all.

[@9:00](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=540.0) \- **Joe Amditis**

Up on the latest, like, you know, what is a vanity metric, what is a real metric, that kind of thing.

[@9:06](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=546.84) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

So what I wanted to say about that is, I think that, well, I mean, let me just use you as a test buddy.

[@9:17](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=557.94) \- **Joe Amditis**

Sure. Right?

[@9:18](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=558.9) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

If you were giving NJCAC money, wouldn't you want to know how many people were reading the materials that we're producing?

Yeah. Right. So it seems pretty basic counting to me, but the thing is, how do we objectively collect the information?

[@9:39](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=579.66) \- **Joe Amditis**

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How do we, yeah, exactly. That's the classic issue is, you know, how do we determine what data points to those conclusions?

How do we determine if that's valid? How do we make sure that what we're looking at and what we're measuring is the thing that actually matters?

And how do we make sure that when we set metrics, we're not like the metric doesn't become the. Test kind of a thing.

[@10:02](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=602.501) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

Yeah, I, you know, I think that Ayinde could tell if we were going to do this, Ayinde could tell them we're only going to do it in aggregate.

But it sounded to me like what you were saying is it's not so easy to get it from Google Analytics because if they don't have Google Analytics set up.

And even if they do, sometimes it's set up terribly and they're not tracking the same things.

[@10:22](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=622.801) \- **Joe Amditis**

And I mean, it's there is a level of standardization, of course, that, you know, we can expect. But I'm just very skeptical.

I'm very hesitant to be like, oh, we'll just get their Google Analytics because they are, you know, in my experience, the computer is not the best.

That's not their favorite tool, let's just say.

[@10:43](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=643.381) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

Yeah, I mean, but if we if we only wanted that one metric. Yeah, we should be we should be good at that.

[@10:49](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=649.201) \- **Joe Amditis**

They definitely are tracking page views. Yeah, that that's right.

[@10:53](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=653.141) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

Right. And I guess I'm saying is if they don't know how to set it up, there's only 43 of them.

[@10:59](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=659.181) \- **Joe Amditis**

We can certainly. We'd get them up and running, yeah.

[@11:01](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=661.741) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

And if that's the only thing we wanted them to accomplish? Yeah, and then the best day to start was yesterday.

[@11:08](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=668.561) \- **Joe Amditis**

The second best is today. So if they don't have it set up and they have no data, we get them set up and then we come back in a month and we take a look and that's a snapshot for us.

[@11:17](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=677.081) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

Yeah, mean, to say out loud to you, because I think I can get you more on my page about why I'm pushing to do this more quickly.

I don't really think that we have any good data. And by that, I mean, if you were trying to convince like a funder or legislators that we're having an impact, I don't see that data really, the data that we're collecting being compelling.

But I just got off the phone with Lindsay who works, you probably know her, right? She does. Yes, yes.

[@11:52](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=712.041) \- **Joe Amditis**

Yeah.

[@11:53](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=713.081) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

She told me that every organization that does this work struggles with this. Because it's amorphous. It's hard to say that because we put information out there that something changed.

Yeah.

[@12:06](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=726.721) \- **Joe Amditis**

Yeah, I mean, my go-to with something like that, when you were saying we don't have a lot of good data, is I always think of the ridiculous amount of closures of newsrooms around the state and the country.

And I think in response to that, obviously, the consortium is actively trying to seed those areas that have lost coverage or never had coverage in the first place.

So I think we can do a little bit with just positioning the data in the context of the absence.

You know, I mean, we can sort of, you know, find the puzzle piece by putting in all the pieces around it, and then we get the shape of the missing piece kind of a thing.

That only can go so far and without actual data. But I think we can start in parallel. Number one, we can move with the Google Analytics stuff because I think that's great.

And number two, we can also make sure that if we don't have the results we want from the Google Analytics, in parallel, we also have something that will tie them over.

sure that if don't do, we For the time being, while we continue to build out the more hard-coded, raw data that we need.

[@13:06](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=786.201) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

Yeah, and I see it as iterative process. I think that, you know, what I'm trying to say, because, you know, Ayinde has to deal with the grantees, right?

And I think if you went to the grantees and said, hey, we're going to capture 100 data elements and you're going to have to collect all this, they're going to revolt, right?

[@13:25](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=805.861) \- **Joe Amditis**

Yes, especially with the initial grant, because I do hear them. They're always paranoid that somebody's going to know their data and then their advertisers aren't going to, you know, pay them as much or something like that, or their competitors are going to blah, blah, blah.

So that, plus the fact that making them do something else, even if it's trivial, like clicking a button and sending an email that wasn't in their initial grant agreement, is going to ruffle a lot of feathers from both of those angles.

So we have to, we just have to make sure that we are mitigating that or accounting for that and anticipating it.

[@13:58](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=838.861) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

Yeah, and I think we have to To understand the limitations of the data that we're able to collect, right, and not to make it the be-all and end-all.

But, you I'll give you an example of how I think about this, because, you know, I work at a radio station, right, and I do a jazz show, right, and there's two ways, right, there's, we have, because we're a terrestrial radio station that serves Connecticut and Long Island, right, there's that audience.

But there's really no way to capture how many people listen.

[@14:32](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=872.842) \- **Joe Amditis**

Right. Right.

[@14:33](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=873.962) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

But we also have a streaming service, and, of course, there's a much smaller number of people that are able to, that stream, right, but of that group, we can measure all of them.

So we're okay with using the proxy, because we don't have the bigger thing that we would really want, and I think that that's the case for NJC.

We're going to have to take proxies, because we're not. There's no way to say that somebody who's 30 years old and is Ayinde's age is changed from TikTok to reading the Jersey Bee.

[@15:10](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=910.482) \- **Joe Amditis**

Yeah. Right.

[@15:11](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=911.842) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

We're just not going to do a research project like that, right? I mean, I think that's what legislators would like to know, but I can't tell them that.

[@15:19](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=919.702) \- **Joe Amditis**

Okay. Is that making sense to you, It is. And it's making me think, too, about, you know, other sources of data that would capture, you know, other than page views, like newsletter subscribers.

When you're talking about listeners and stuff, newsletter subscribers is another one where they're very guarded about it. They don't want to show you or something.

And even if you get the raw number, that doesn't even mean as much as, you know, like when you say, oh, we have this many viewers on opening night.

Right. And the Nielsen ratings are showing that. And it's like 20 percent of them are bars with persistent TVs on that nobody's actually watching kind of a thing.

**ACTION ITEM: Build/run social scraper for 43 grantees (last 25 posts); share results w/ Lisa \+ Ayinde \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=958.9999)**

Like, I know that that data is actually accounted for because they get enterprise licenses or whatever. But my point is.

Even when we get those, there are other soft metrics that don't necessarily show the full picture. So we want to make sure we get page views.

want to get newsletter subscribers. Maybe we do – I'm going to write a scraper to go and look at all their social media accounts and see their followers, their last 25 posts, and the number of likes and comments and shares on them.

All that data is public. So if we look at their social media activity, that they don't have to do anything, we can get a sense and compare what they're giving us from the Google Analytics and their newsletter subscribers if they give it to us with what we're seeing in terms of public engagement on the platforms.

Because even though that doesn't capture all of it, that does give us a sense of comparison. So if they're saying, oh, I have 200,000 newsletter subscribers, I don't know how to get to the opens or the click-throughs, and then we look on their social media posts and they have four likes as their max, that may just point that the people love their newsletter, but it also may point that we need to dial in a little bit and make sure that.

The data they're giving us is actually reflective of the impact and the reach that they're having. Am I monologuing a little here?

I'm sorry.

[@17:07](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1027.54) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

No, that's right. And to come up with something that Ayinde can sell to the grantees that they can really do is – and I think the thing that's attractive to me about this particular idea of scraping or using Google Analytics is that they wouldn't have to do anything once we set it up.

[@17:24](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1044.92) \- **Joe Amditis**

I love doing that because it saves a lot of headaches, especially if I can – after this, I have two Eventbrites that I have to make, but tonight I can start putting together a basic social media scraper.

I just did that. Actually, it's already put together. I just did a similar thing for looking at influencers in New Jersey with Carrie Brown for a report that's coming out.

So I can repurpose that scraper infrastructure to just say, instead of looking at these, you know, 50 influencers, look at these, what do you say, 43 – 43 consortium grantees, which we already have data sets for with the map.

So we have the – We have their information, a lot of context about them, and we can just repurpose that scraper infrastructure to start pulling, let's say, again, the last 25 social media posts from each grantee on every platform that we decide to look at.

You know, Twitter, Blue Sky, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, threads, guess, but TikTok, YouTube, things like that. And once we get a list of all their URLs, which we have a lot of them already, it's just a matter of hitting the button and letting my computer run while Python does its thing.

Ayinde, is this sounding good to you?

[@18:33](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1113.54) \- **Ayinde Merrill (njcivicinfo.org)**

Yeah, think that the reason why I love Joe, because he can automate things, and as much as we can automate it, we, and I know some of our grants is going be pissed off.

I don't know if they'll, they won't totally voice that to me, they'll voice it to Stephanie after, or Joe after they, after they meet with me.

But I think as much as we can automate it and make it as easy as possible, I think that works.

[@18:58](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1138.92) \- **Joe Amditis**

much. um

[@19:00](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1140.0) \- **Ayinde Merrill (njcivicinfo.org)**

And I think we can also pitch like, hey, this is also just good for you in the long run.

Yeah, this is how we keep getting more grant money.

[@19:06](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1146.62) \- **Joe Amditis**

Do you want to keep getting grant money from us or not? Yeah, that's always a pitch. We know this is annoying.

We know that this is coming in the middle of a grant cycle, but we're doing it so that next grant cycle is more money and there is a next grant cycle.

So whatever you can do to help us is great. And anything that we can do to make it so that you don't have to bother with this, let us know.

And then, of course, we're concerned and very vigilant about privacy and proprietary propriety. So let us know any special considerations you want us to take with your information, and we'll do our best to make sure that we don't violate that.

And if we if we feel like we have to or they're unreasonable, we can have a conversation with the individual grantee or maybe even exclude them and just note that in the report.

You know, we got 42 out of 43 grantees, 43 had an objection or it was a complicate, whatever, if we really want to give them that leeway even.

[@19:57](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1197.58) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

Yeah, I mean, I think in the future, any grants that. We give, if we decide that setting up a basic, because I think when you're thinking about Google Analytics, you're way more technically understanding of that than I am, right?

I'm thinking like super basic, like I just want to know how many people looked at their page, right?

[@20:17](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1217.98) \- **Joe Amditis**

That is, wouldn't that be great if Google let you just do that really easily? Google is seriously terrible at this, and that's why I think that even if they had like logged into Google Analytics or said yes, check the boxes, yes, I want to automatically, you know, create a Google Analytics for this, you know, web hosting account or whatever, whether or not they've looked at it, they've set it up fully, they've, you know, tagged things on their CMS appropriately or whatever they do.

Sometimes I've seen publishers, instead of creating posts, their entire website is created with new pages instead of a new post, which up Google Analytics, right?

Like there are just so many beautiful end user ways that they are, that people somehow- screw it up. Yeah.

And it's likely that we won't have crazy ones like that. I'm just saying that even if they've gotten that far and they've set it up, we don't even know if they have set it up the way that that would make sense and would be useful.

So we should get a sense of whether or not they have. We should let them know that eligibility for future grant cycles will be dependent on a setup functioning analytics system, even if we don't want to be strictly Google people.

Maybe they don't use Google Analytics, maybe use some other monopoly on the Internet or whatever, but it should be a prerequisite for consideration.

I think going forward, that's that'll solve so many of our problems. But for now, we can get them set up or see what they need, see what they have and run in parallel.

run those social media metrics bots to go see if we can figure out at least some baseline. If they don't give us anything, we have something.

[@21:52](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1312.62) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

Yeah. And do you feel like the next step is to get Blue Engine involved here?

[@21:56](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1316.04) \- **Joe Amditis**

Yeah, that's that's going to be huge because it may very well be that they already know. Like, oh, yeah, we're good.

You can, they all have, like, I might just be overanalyzing or overthinking it because Blue Engine is a professional organization that does this stuff.

**ACTION ITEM: Schedule Blue Engine mtg w/ David, Joe, Lisa; target Jan 8, else next week \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1325.9999)**

So they probably have a better idea. So I would definitely start with them. And I still do the script first, so.

Okay. All right.

[@22:16](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1336.0) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

So why don't we do this? Ayinde, would you be able to set up a meeting with David and Joe and you and me?

Yeah, I can do that. I'll do that today.

[@22:28](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1348.1) \- **Ayinde Merrill (njcivicinfo.org)**

Yeah.

[@22:29](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1349.08) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

And Joe, when are you back from your trip?

[@22:32](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1352.48) \- **Joe Amditis**

Friday. This is crazy. haven't gone to a conference this long. It's forever. So I guess, Ayinde, sometime next week.

[@22:39](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1359.66) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

Is there anything that you're doing next week?

[@22:41](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1361.44) \- **Joe Amditis**

can do it this week. I can do it this week. You know what's so funny? I thought I was speaking at this conference this whole time.

And I am not. They are absolutely not. I don't know why I thought that. I forgot my wallet in New Jersey.

No, no. I travel with a password because I don't have to realize. This is... 2026 has been the most tight...

B year so far for me. And I've never, it's worked out so weirdly well. Like last night, the big dinner, the randomly, one of the organizations was like, we're paying for it on our card.

Didn't have to use a card, didn't have to use my wallet. Went to the bar, the hotel let me check in with a tap to pay instead of a credit card.

And the doors, the Hilton app has a virtual key. So I don't even need to carry my loose hotel key card in my back pocket.

But I am, there's like, like I said, the session sucked. There's like one or two I maybe want to see if I feel like it.

So I'm pretty much going to be on my computer until I leave on Friday. And on Friday, it is a five hour, four hour flight back.

So I'll be on Slack, but anything other than Friday, I can do, well, wait, what's today? Wednesday? Wednesday, do you want to try for Thursday?

We can try tomorrow, that is all I'm saying. I'll see you, David, it's free tomorrow. Yeah, that's sorry. That was a 42 minute way to say I'm good tomorrow, but yeah.

Yeah, but I'm so sorry.

[@23:57](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1437.04) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

How did you get on the plane without your My passport, I'm a passport.

[@24:00](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1440.0) \- **Joe Amditis**

I have a passport, so I, you know. Joe, I'm a passport bro, too. I don't have my real ID, even.

I don't have my I'm not doing that. That's government surveillance right there. No. I have my passport with me, and I have my credit card, high-def pictures in the front and back of my license and credit cards on my phone in my secure folder and .

So, like, I'm good, but if I break my phone, it's over. I can't even pay for a new one.

Like, it's because it's on the phone. So, I'm going be a full-time Phoenician here, if that's the case.

[@24:31](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1471.96) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

As in, you're never coming back to New Jersey? I won't be able to leave Phoenix.

[@24:35](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1475.68) \- **Joe Amditis**

Yeah, I'll start walking.

[@24:37](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1477.08) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

That is really fun. All right. So, why don't you try for tomorrow, Allende? And if that doesn't work, then next week?

That sounds like a fire. Yeah. And, you know, again, I just want to say to both of you, I'm only trying to think of, like, the absolute simplest things that we could do to start off with that would have some kind of measurement impact.

That when I end. They and I are talking to legislators that we have an answer to the question. How do you even know that anybody is reading what you're writing?

[@25:08](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1508.12) \- **Joe Amditis**

Yeah. And before we jump off, though, I just want to make sure I know Hannah's not here and I was hoping she would be.

I just really want to be sensitive to the ownership and, you know, role and the hard work that she's done.

I don't want her to feel like as especially as taking over that I'm coming because I didn't know that like I didn't know that you guys had already spoken to her about this.

I thought when you called me, were just like, hey, I just had some questions about like data and stuff.

And I just don't want her to perceive it as me kind of being like, all right, get out of the way.

I'll figure it out. Like kind of a thing, you know? No, no.

[@25:40](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1540.62) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

I think that, you know, what I want to say about what Hannah is doing, it's very specific and helpful in the sense if you were a funder and you had an endowment and you wanted to know information about the grants that you're providing, like she's doing a great job in that space.

[@25:58](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1558.82) \- **Joe Amditis**

Which I'm talking about.

[@26:00](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1560.0) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

Something different, which is if I want to talk to a funder, if I want to talk to the legislators, and I want to say we're having an impact, right, I need five or six measures that off the top of my head I could say, oh, well, you say no one reads it, but Ayinde and I both can tell you 100,000 people in 12 months read, we have 43 grantees, and that's how many people in aggregate read, right?

[@26:24](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1584.4) \- **Joe Amditis**

Yeah, as long as, I think, I would prefer if I, my role would be pitched as the automation or scraping guy.

I don't want her to think that I'm doing a data job, because data and research are her thing. I'm doing computer.

I'm just, Joe is computer, so that's fine. But as long, if we can just position me as more along those lines, so it doesn't even come off as a whiff of me usurping her role as a data or research expert, because she is.

I can do that. Numbers scare me. Like, literally, I don't. So, so I, she is going to be the one that saves us from.

Some embarrassment, which is way more crucial. So it has to be, she has to approve and understand and like verify what I'm doing.

I'm only able to gather masses of data, whether or not it's useful or not, and I don't know how to parse it.

So that's, that will have to be her like final, you know.

[@27:20](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1640.86) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

I just want to be clear. Like, first of all, I'm not in any way criticizing what she's doing. I'm more saying that for the purpose I needed.

I got you completely.

[@27:33](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1653.24) \- **Joe Amditis**

Yeah. For me being overanxious about that kind of thing, because I do tend to take up a lot of space and I just don't, I don't like to do that all the time.

[@27:42](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1662.76) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

But I also want to, I also want to separate something out because I think what we're asking you is mostly counting.

Yeah.

[@27:50](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1670.9) \- **Joe Amditis**

Okay.

[@27:51](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1671.14) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

It's actually, it's really not research. It's just like some basic, right. Does that make sense to you?

[@27:56](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1676.9) \- **Joe Amditis**

Yeah. Yep. Yep. I can count mostly. Yeah. All right.

[@28:01](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1681.44) \- **Lisa Sahulka**

So we'll try and get this set up either for tomorrow or next week. And I hope that the conference, even though I doubt it, gets better.

[@28:10](https://fathom.video/share/22SbfnfTcz6Ho9zvKFy2BRV_d4PwvnnU?timestamp=1690.98) \- **Joe Amditis**

Well, at the very least, I hope it gets funnier. That'll be good. And I got to do my first ride in a Waymo in a robot driverless car last night.

Oh, my God. How was that? It was, an idiot. It would have been great, except I didn't check how far the place was, the restaurant we're going to.

So it literally did not finish the tutorial like that. It reads out to you when you get in the car before it was like, all right, get out.

You're good. So I was very glad that there was no human being sitting in the front seat to look back at me and go, you piece of .

You just took an Uber blocks like you piece of . The robot didn't judge me. But at the very least, that was a positive.

It was really it was wild. It was really cool. I want to do it again. But everything's really close together where I need to be.

So but OK, awesome. I got to go. I actually do have to go to a session that I kind of want to see.

But I will talk to I'll see soon. I'll started on the scraper tonight. Thanks for your help with this.

Of course. All right. Bye. Bye.
